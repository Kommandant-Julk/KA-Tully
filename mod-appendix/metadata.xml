REQUIRES MULTIVERSE TO WORK
This mod replaces the sprite/text for admiral Tully, turning them into a dark skinned female in line with their depiction in the YouTube series "Kestrel Adventures".
Now compatible with MV 5.2.1 (should be compatible with later versions hopefully)

Special thanks to:
- Kommandant_Julk for removing all the clobbering.
- MV devs for such a great mod and the Tully sprite

Changelog:
1.1
- removed clobbering
- reduced file size
- now no longer breaks stuff (hopefully)

1.2
- now affects storage check and (hopefully) all other mentions of Tully's gender
- miniship of tully crewser (that little picture in hangar that shows a tiny version of that ship) no longer displays vanilla Tully
- changed all mentions of "Brodric Tully" to "Jane Tully"
- now compatible with Forgemaster mod! (until more entry texts get added)
